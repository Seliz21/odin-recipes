    <p>A strawberry smoothie can be made with fresh or frozen strawberries. Our recipe calls for frozen berries, since they make for a nice thick smoothie. If you're using fresh berries, add a few ice cubes to thicken it up. If you're using frozen strawberries, you can use either whole or pre-sliced berries. Pre-sliced are easier to blend, but most blenders can handle whole berries—just make sure to blend long enough to achieve a smooth consistency.</p>
